        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_balnk " title="HTML specification">Hypertext Markup 
            Language</a> (HTML) is the standard markup language 
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style 
        Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or 
        fromlocal storage and render the documents into multimedia web
        pages.</p> HTML describes the structure of a web page 
        semantically and originally included cues for the appearance
        of the document.
        constructs, images and other objects such as interactive 
        forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <p>HTML 
        provides a means to create structured documents by denoting 
        structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,     
        lists, links, quotes and other items.<img src="bg.jpg" width="100%">  HTML elements are 
        delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
        directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as 
        surround and provide information about document text and 
            may include other</p>
            tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML 
            tags, but use them to interpret the content of the 
            page
